      <p>
        My name is Becky and this is my first ever webpage,
        created on a hot day in August with a team of web developers from JSOxford.

      <div id="main">
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>I enjoy craft projects of many kinds: cardmaking, scrapbooking, sewing/machine embroidery, crochet,
        silversmithing/metal work, printing and really any arty thing I can get my teeth into.
        I carry out projects in my own time, usually having been inspired by attending a workshop or class showing
        a particular technique.</p>

        <h3>Crafty Cards</h3>
        <p>I create a lot of my cards using supplies from a company called Stampin' Up! These include rubber stamps,
        punches for cutting out shapes from cardstock and then various embellishemnts such as ribbon, brads, eyelets
        and gems. I am also a general hoarder, so I use many other bits and pieces I have lying about in my craft stash.</p>

        <h3>Crafty Crochet</h3>
        <p>With help from a very kind colleague at work I learnt some basic crochet about 2 years ago now.
        My two goals at the time were to make a traditional 'granny square' and some sort of flower.
        I managed both and am currently trying to make a blanket using 'granny stripes'. </p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

        <p>I think I will continue to talk about crafting here, as I don't seem to have any hobbies outside of this area!!</p>

        <h3>Sewing things</h3>
        <p>I've tried to get back into using my sewing machine recently. Attending a few classes along the way
        I have made a few cool things: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A bucket bag</li>
          <li>A skirt</li>
          <li>A pair of pyjamas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Silversmithing/Jewellery making</h3>
        <p>After meeting a super inspiring lady at a christian arts conference last year,
          I took a 10 week course in metalwork, and two day classes in silversmithing and enamelling. I have made:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a copper brooch</li>
          <li>a couple of silver rings</li>
          <li>a pair of earrings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>
        <h3>Hmm...</h3>
        <p>Some fun things about myself...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have an identical twin sister</li>
          <li>I am married to a 6ft surfing potter who knits, programs and has an allotment.
            He also happens to have a PhD in pure Maths!</li>
          <li>During the day I work as an Archives Assistant and have a soft spot for libraries in general.</li>
        </ul>
